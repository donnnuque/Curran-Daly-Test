# Technical-Assessment

Please find in this repository my entry for the Amaysim technical test (Shopping Cart).

The AmaysimTestIdeone.java was coded and tested in an online dev environment Ideone.com.
The code can be copy-pasted in Ideone and run as is.

The other java files are the same classes in the above mentioned file 
but separated in difference class files (public class) for review purposes.
Main class is AmysimTest which contains the main() method and test scenarios.

Testing was only done in Ideone.com using code in AmaysimTestIdeone.java.
The java files (other than AmaysimTestIdeone) can be compiled and run in JDK6
but were not tested due to lack of coding environment in my station (internet shop).
